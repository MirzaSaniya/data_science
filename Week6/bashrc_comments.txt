# To enable the settings / commands in this file for login shells as well,
# this file has to be sourced in /etc/profile.
# If not running interactively, don't do anything
# check the window size after each command and, if necessary,
# update the values of LINES and COLUMNS.
# set variable identifying the chroot you work in (used in the prompt below)
# set a fancy prompt (non-color, overwrite the one in /etc/profile)
# Commented out, don't overwrite xterm -T "title" -n "icontitle" by default.
# If this is an xterm set the title to user@host:dir
